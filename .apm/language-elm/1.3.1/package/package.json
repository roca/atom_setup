Open up a terminal\n  2. `npm install -g elm-oracle`\n  3. `which elm-oracle` on Unix/Linux or `where.exe elm-oracle` on Windows\n  4. Copy the path to elm-oracle\n  5. Open up the language-elm settings in Atom  \n    - Open up the Atom Settings / Preferences tab\n    - Click on \"Packages\"\n    - Find the \"language-elm\" package in the list\n    - Click \"Settings\"\n  6. Paste the path into \"The elm-oracle executable path\" setting\n\nThanks to the authors of [Elm Oracle](https://github.com/ElmCast/elm-oracle)\n\n## Jump to Symbol\n\nAtom's native symbol-view package uses ctags, and thus doesn't support Elm without extra configuration. But this plugin https://atom.io/packages/goto uses langauge definition files to identify symbols, and does support Elm as long as atom-elm is installed.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/edubkendo/atom-elm/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/edubkendo/atom-elm#readme","_id":"language-elm@1.3.1","_shasum":"e0dec4f8ea7e48900f9a0185aa3c7e1c6879023a","_resolved":"file:../d-11608-5282-1syj1w/package.tgz","_from":"../d-11608-5282-1syj1w/package.tgz"}
