[Install `elm`](http://elm-lang.org/install).\n2. Install [`linter`](https://github.com/atom-community/linter), [`language-elm`](https://github.com/atom-community/language-elm), and [`linter-elm-make`](https://github.com/atom-community/linter-elm-make) from the Settings view (`Edit` > `Preferences` > `Install`) or by running these from the command line:\n```\napm install linter\napm install language-elm\napm install linter-elm-make\n```\n3. Run `which elm-make` (Unix/Linux) or `where.exe elm-make` (Windows) from the command line and set the result as your executable path in this installed package's configuration.\n\n## Configuration\n\n#### `Lint On The Fly`\nBy default, linting is only done after saving the file.  If you want to lint while typing, turn on the `Lint On The Fly` option in the package settings.  Also make sure that the `Lint As You Type` option is enabled in the [linter](https://github.com/atom-community/linter) package settings.\n\n#### `Always Compile Main`\nIf enabled, the main file(s) will always be compiled instead of the active file.  The main files can be set using `Linter Elm Make: Set Main Paths`.  If not set, the linter will look for `Main.elm` files in the source directories.  Take note that if this is enabled, modules unreachable from the main modules will not be linted.  Disabled by default.\n\n#### `Report Warnings`\nShow `elm-make` warnings.  Enabled by default.\n\n#### `Work Directory`\n- If this is not blank, the linter will copy the source files from the project directory into this directory and use this as the working directory for `elm-make`.  This can be an absolute path or relative to the path of `elm-package.json`.\n\n  If `Lint On The Fly` is disabled, this option will prevent the linter from using your project directory's `elm-stuff`.  This can be useful if you're using other tools to build your output files.\n\n- If this is blank and `Lint On The Fly` is enabled, the linter will create a temporary directory before running the first linting process for the project.  It will then copy the source files from the project directory into the temporary directory.  The linter will do all of this again when Atom gets restarted.  Setting the value of `Work Directory` will shorten the duration of the first lint after a restart since the linter does not need to create a temporary directory and copy files anymore.\n\n- If this is blank and `Lint On The Fly` is disabled, the linter will use the project directory as the working directory for `elm-make`.\n\nIf this option is not blank, a file watcher will watch the project directory for source file changes and synchronize those with the work directory.\n\nIMPORTANT WARNING: If the work directory is inside the project directory and you want to change the value of `Work Directory`, delete the work directory first!  Else, the linter will consider the work directory as part of your project.\n\nIf this option makes no sense and/or is confusing, just leave it blank. :)\n\n## Quick Fixes\n\n#### `Linter Elm Make: Quick Fix`\nMove your cursor to a problematic text range and invoke this command to show the possible fixes. Select a fix from the list to apply it to your code.\n\n![quick-fix](https://github.com/mybuddymichael/linter-elm-make/blob/master/images/quick-fix.png?raw=true)\n\n#### `Linter Elm Make: Quick Fix All`\nFixes all issues in the active text editor in one go. If there is more than one fix for an issue, it will choose the first from the list.\n\nYou may also add something like this in your `keymap.cson`:\n\n```\n'atom-text-editor:not([mini])[data-grammar^=\"source elm\"]':\n  'f6': 'linter-elm-make:quick-fix'\n  'shift-f6': 'linter-elm-make:quick-fix-all'\n\n'.linter-elm-make atom-text-editor[mini]':\n    'f6': 'core:confirm'\n```\n\n## Useful Commands\n\n#### `Linter Elm Make: Set Main Paths`\nSets the main paths of the project and saves it to `elm-package.json`.\n\nExample:\n```\n\"linter-elm-make\": {\n  \"mainPaths\": [\"Todo.elm\"]\n}\n```\nThe main paths are only relevant if `Always Compile Main` is enabled.  See [above](https://github.com/mybuddymichael/linter-elm-make#always-compile-main).\n\n#### `Linter Elm Make: Clear Project Build Artifacts`\nDeletes the `.elmi` and `.elmo` files in your project's build artifacts directory (e.g. elm-stuff/build-artifacts/0.17.0/user/project/1.0.0).  This is useful after toggling `Lint On The Fly` and/or `Always Compile Main` to prevent confusing lint results.  If using a work directory or temporary directory, the artifact files of that directory will also be deleted.\n\n#### `Linter Elm Make: Toggle Lint On The Fly`\n\n#### `Linter Elm Make: Toggle Always Compile Main`\n\n#### `Linter Elm Make: Toggle Report Warnings`\n\n## Prior Art\n\nThe boilerplate code here is repurposed from [linter-hlint](https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-hlint).
