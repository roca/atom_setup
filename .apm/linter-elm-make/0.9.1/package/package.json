[Install `elm`](http://elm-lang.org/install).\n1. `$ apm install linter`\n1. `$ apm install language-elm`\n1. `$ apm install linter-elm-make`\n1. `$ which elm-make` and set that as your executable path in this installed package's configuration.\n\n## Configuration\n\n### Lint On The Fly\nBy default, linting is only done after saving the file.  If you want to lint while typing, turn on the `Lint On The Fly` option in the package settings.  Also make sure that the `Lint As You Type` option is enabled in the [linter](https://github.com/atom-community/linter) package settings.\n\n### Always Compile Main\nTo always compile `Main.elm` files in source directories instead of compiling the active file, turn on the `Always Compile Main` option.  Take note that if this is enabled, modules unreachable from the main modules will not be linted.\n\n### Report Warnings\nEnable this to show `elm-make` warnings.\n\n## Quick Fixes\n\nMove your cursor to a problematic text range and invoke `Linter Elm Make: Quick Fix` to show the possible fixes. Select a fix from the list to apply it to your code.\n\n![quick-fix](https://github.com/mybuddymichael/linter-elm-make/blob/master/images/quick-fix.png?raw=true)\n\nInvoking `Linter Elm Make: Quick Fix All` will fix all the issues in the active text editor. If there is more than one fix for an issue, it will choose the first from the list.\n\nYou may also add something like this in your `keymap.cson`:\n\n```\n'atom-text-editor:not([mini])[data-grammar^=\"source elm\"]':\n  'f6': 'linter-elm-make:quick-fix'\n  'shift-f6': 'linter-elm-make:quick-fix-all'\n\n'.linter-elm-make atom-text-editor[mini]':\n    'f6': 'core:confirm'\n```\n\n## Other Useful Commands\n\n### `Linter Elm Make: Toggle Lint On The Fly`\n\n### `Linter Elm Make: Toggle Always Compile Main`\n\n### `Linter Elm Make: Clear Project Build Artifacts`\nDeletes the `*.elmi` and `*.elmo` files in your project's build artifacts directory (e.g. elm-stuff/build-artifacts/0.17.0/user/project/1.0.0).  This is useful after toggling `Lint On The Fly` and/or `Always Compile Main` to prevent confusing lint results.\n\n## Prior Art\n\nThe boilerplate code here is repurposed from [linter-hlint](https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-hlint).
