Works best for stateless components.\n\n![Atom React Preview](http://i.imgur.com/66qpRAd.gif)\n\n## Features:\n\n* Reload your component on save\n* Editing the props in the preview area\n* Saving the edits for when you save your component\n\nLike hot reloading, but within Atom!\n\n## Known issues:\n\n* If you import other things in top of your component, like LESS/SASS styles, it'll break ([Issue #1](https://github.com/VictorBjelkholm/atom-react-preview/issues/1))\n* You need to specify `'use babel'` in the top of the file ([Issue #2](https://github.com/VictorBjelkholm/atom-react-preview/issues/2))\n* Doesn't load correctly when reloading window (opening/closing the panel solves this problem) ([Issue #3](https://github.com/VictorBjelkholm/atom-react-preview/issues/3))\n* The codebase is a mess, based on atom-html-preview and only got time for minor refactoring atm, will get to that ([Issue #4](https://github.com/VictorBjelkholm/atom-react-preview/issues/4))\n\n## Install:\n\n### apm\n\n```bash\napm install atom-react-preview\n```\n\n### Inside Atom:\n\nGo to \"Install Packages\" and search for atom-react-preview\n\n## Toggle React Preview ##\n\nPress `CTRL-SHIFT-M` in the editor to open the preview pane.\n\n## Thanks\n\nThanks to https://github.com/webBoxio/atom-html-preview which 90% of the code is coming from. It got me to understand how Atom packages works and served as a base for this package. Thanks @webBoxio!\n"}
