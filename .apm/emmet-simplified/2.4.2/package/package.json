This is a fork of the emmet-atom package, and has one key-binding, and one key-binding ony: the <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>space</kbd> key for emmet expanding. This solves all keybinding conflicts with the Atom Core, such as the <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> for toggling the Markdown preview, the <kbd>ctrl</kbd> +  <kbd>,</kbd> for opening the Settings View, and recently <kbd>tab</kbd> for [Atom's new autocomplete](http://blog.atom.io/2015/05/15/new-autocomplete.html). \n\nOther than that, there are - as of yet - no differences with emmet-atom, which means that you have the freedom to manually add any other Emmet triggers you want. To do so, go to _Edit_ > _Open Your Keymap_ and refer to the [original default emmet-atom keymap](https://github.com/emmetio/emmet-atom/blob/master/keymaps/emmet.cson) for a complete list of commands.\n\n### Installation\nIn Atom, open Preferences > Packages, search for the `emmet-simplified` package.
