# RailsCasts Prime theme

Syntax theme for Atom editor, based on the RailsCast TextMate theme.

Tweaks have been made to make comments more discreet in the source code,
and have some colors be slightly different in some cases. For example :

- make brackets #{} in Haml/Slim more visible
- separate color for classes names and constants
- different blue for ruby symbols and keywords (like true)
